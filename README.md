# Prediction model of CoronaVirus (COVID-19) at New York City

Ming Gong and I will expore the prediction model of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at New York City . Mathematical statistics and support vectorregression analysis are used for comprehensive prediction analysis. 
   
We plans to use our machine learning knowledge to get data from Chinaâ€™s cities (expecially Wuhan, the origin of the coronavirus), and use the features such as medical resources (Hospital beds per 1,000 people), population density, protective suits number, face musk number to fit a regression model that predict the coronovirus spread activitiy (number of patient who tested postive for COVID-19).
    
The analysis gives the short and medium term future data and change trend curve, for analysis and reference of relevant personnel, and the model could be a instructural tool for avoid more spread of coronavirus at other cities.
